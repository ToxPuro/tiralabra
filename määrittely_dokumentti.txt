I will do the project using Python and it's library Numpy
I mainly are fluent in Python and Javascript, but can understand Java code fairly well
In my project I will build a backpropagation algorithm that helps neural nets learn their mistakes by derivate calculus
I will also implement different learning algorithms like Adam, which all are modifications of stocasthic gradient descent
Also one could regard convolutions as their own algorithm
I will build the neural net by myself, which will mainly just use Numpy-matrices so no need for separate data structures
The problem at hand is classifying hand-written digits. I choice neural nets, and CNN-architechture, because it's the best solution around
The program will get hand-written digits from MNIST dataset as input
I am a TKT-student and will do this project in english
