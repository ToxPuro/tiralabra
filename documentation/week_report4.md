Hours used: 18

This was a productive week. I managed to make the first prototype of the neural network and it actually works!.
I managed to get a test coverage ~95% which seems good enough for me. Also pylint score over 8 is good for me.
Coded convolution network which used the layers that I had done before. Also splitted the actual training process to a solver module.
This seems to be a quite common approach in machine learning communities and seemed clean solution.
Did some accuracy testing and got over 95% accuracy with a small amount of training. Going to put images of these to repository later next week.

Since the coding part seems to have gone well next week I should focus on lacking documentation
