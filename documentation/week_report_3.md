This week I took a head first approach to the project and started the actual coding.
I coded batchnorm, max pooling and convolution layers. Also coded other update rules then sgd.
Set up testing documentation and pylint for code quality.
By far most challenging was making convolution layers fast, max pooling layers were also challenging.
First coded with loops but that is really slow, luckily found help from online and found the im2col way.
Next week I plan to build the neural net from the layers I have and test it on the MNIST dataset
