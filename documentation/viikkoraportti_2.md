During the first week of the project I came up with the actual approach of building my neural network, after taking inspiration from multidute of sources.
Actual coding was rather limited and I should have probably done more of it
Also came up with an idea how to test my methods and functions.
For those calculations that can be simulated compare aganist simulations and for those that can't compare to already done functions or to themselfs
with the idea of keeping out regression bugs.
Next week I will do all things that I was too lazy to do this week as set up pylint, set up some tracking for code coverage and start actually coding more
on the project.
Could also set up automated testing, although this doesn't seem important since I am working alone on code which testing scripts can be easily run
I used about 8 hours this week, mostly planning.
I learned how other people how implemented neural nets on plain numpy and how they are implemented on popular libraries.
The neuron/layer and cache API gave me a practical idea on how to carry forward. Backpropagation and the mathematics I was already familiar with
